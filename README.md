# Introduction:

  Welcome to this Repo, it contains various **solved** and **tested** problems and quizzes in ** _C++ programming language_ **, for learning purposes.
  Problems are adressed in a certain way to handle different Cpp concepts such as **Oop**, **String manipulation**, **Enumeration classes** ... 
  Each problem contains the correspending instructions with the reference of it.
  This repo follows the **TDD** (*Test-Driven-Develepoment*) approach, it means that the Tests for the problems are already written, start by making enough code to avoid compilation errors, then make the first *Test-Case* pass and continue with the same approach for the rest of the *Test-Cases*.
  
# What you need to start:
  
  + basic knowledge in Cpp programming, oriented-object programming, algorithmics and analysis. problems go from easy to diffuclt so you'll learn more as you solve more problems.
  + Coding passion and problem-solving mindset
  
# Tools Prerequisite:

  * Any C++ compiler + code editor (e.g: Visual Studio (**_recommanded_**))
  * Any Build system to build your code locally (e.g: Cmake (**_recommanded_**))
  * Install **_Git bash_** to store and keep track on changes you made during your process
  * You may need to add the **UT framework** _Catch2_
  
# Repository Structure:

  As you can see in the following exemple (_local repo_) each problem is located in a folder, and each quiz folder contains:
  
    * An empty cpp implementation and header code files + the test file.
    * _README.md_ text document : contains the problem instructions and references.
    * _test folder_ for catch framework.
    
  ### Note:
    Each problem folder contains the **_CMakeLists_** document that configure for you the build of your Cpp code, to focus more on the problem not the build (if you're using Cmake with Visual Studio IDE. if not please ignore)
